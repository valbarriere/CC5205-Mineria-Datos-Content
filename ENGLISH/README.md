# CC5205-Data-Mining-Content

Repository of the Data Mining course taught at the Computer Science Department of the University of Chile. 

The version of this class is more focused on Machine Learning than Data Mining. It is more aligned with current technology and uses. It is very much based on what can be found in [the scikit-learn tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html).   

- [The lectures per se](https://valbarriere.github.io/minerias) with explanations, and where the recordings were found after each lecture.

- [Course Rules](course_rules.md)

- [Section 3 Calendar](cal_S3.md)

- [Project Suggestions](project_suggestions.md)
