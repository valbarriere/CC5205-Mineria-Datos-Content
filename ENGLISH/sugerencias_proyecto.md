# Suggested datasets for the project

* The dataset should allow them to develop a Data Mining process where they ask **questions**, apply descriptive and predictive methods, interpret the results, etc.

* Ideally, it should be a large volume (many rows) and of high dimensionality (several tens of columns). 

* If it is a competition dataset we would like you to come up with alternative tasks with the data and not just what is proposed in the competition. A goal of the project is that you can extract knowledge from the data and not just ‘blindly’ maximise a hit rate. In case of datasets with public analysis (like notebooks) it goes without saying that your work must be different.

* An important part of the project and in Data Mining in general is reproducibility. In that sense in your reports, briefings and presentations you should include references to the dataset used (links) whenever possible.

### Some ideas

- **Awesome Data Chile**: Curated list of public data sources on Chile compiled by the IMFD: https://github.com/imfd/awesome-data-chile

- **COVID 19**: There are several public datasets on the pandemic.
  - [COVID19 Chile Data - Jorge Perez Repository](https://github.com/jorgeperezrojas/covid19-data)
  - [COVID19 Global Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-1/overview)
  - [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset](https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19)

- **Fairness & Bias (Data Science for Social Good)**: A new problem arises with the use of Machine Learning and Data Mining in social contexts, such as bias and discrimination. This suggests finding ways to create models that allow different groups to be treated ‘fairly’, but the definition of fairness is complex and the problems carry over from the generation of the data, the interpretation of the data and the models, and how they impact on the future. For example, an emblematic case in the United States was that of a company that offered a prediction of criminals' risk of re-offending, and this score is used by judges to adjust sentences. It was observed that this score was assigned in an unbalanced way to different racial or ethnic groups. The aim of this project is to identify these biases and find ways to reduce them, or conclude that there is no such solution.

- **Chilean Constituent Process**: The data portal of the Government of Chile released the information of the Proceedings of Local Self-Convened Meetings of the Chilean Constituent Process of 2016. The information is public and work has already been done to automate some data classification tasks.

- **Characterising and classifying Competitive Programming problems**: Sites such as [http://codeforces.com](http://codeforces.com/), [http://www.spoj.com](http://www.spoj.com/), [http://a2oj.com](http://a2oj.com/), or [http://uhunt.felix-halim.net](http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/), among others, are repositories of programming problems for competitions such as the ACM-ICPC, IEEExtreme, Google Code Jam, etc. An interesting application is to characterise the problems, given the categories (many of them are tagged with tags, or with user comments), classify a problem into its categories, or create a ‘recommender’ of problems of a certain difficulty and/or topic. There are many classifications of problems, either in online judges (such as those referenced above), or by users who solve these problems (in blogs, github, etc.).
