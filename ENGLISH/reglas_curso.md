# Course Rules

The course follows a face-to-face modality supported by some remote activities. You will be able to access asynchronously the material published on the [Website](https://valbarriere.github.io/minerias/). The lectures will be in hybrid format, the lectures will be recorded, and visible online on the same website.
Note: the videos available on the [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKUV14d0mKnUXXfmhqqZdcsNGAuV2GZda) are not updated.

The course has the following Units.

1. Data Exploration
2. Supervised Learning: Classification and Regression
3. Clustering
4. Advanced Topics: Attribute Selection and Attribute Reduction, Neural Networks
5. Other topics that may vary from semester to semester (privacy, interpretability, ethics).

## Assessments

The course consists of three types of assessments.

### Formative Labs

Seven formative labs and one remedial lab to replace the worst grade.

The lab is intended to be done during class time, i.e., approximately 1 hour. However, it can be handed in until 23:59 on the day of the lab. The lab is done in a classroom format. However, it can be completed after hours.

The lab includes programming problems in which you will apply the practical content seen in class.

These activities must be done in groups of 2 people.

### Mini-controls

Before each laboratory there will be a mini-control in which theoretical aspects or concepts seen in previous classes will be asked.

It consists of 1 or 2 written questions, without notes.

It is to be completed and handed in during the first 15 minutes of the auxiliary class.

The mini-reading test is individual and face-to-face.

The remedial lab also includes a mini-retest.

**Note: **Only the school's formal mechanisms for absences will be considered.

### Project

Project (in groups of 5 people): evaluated in 2 milestones (or stages) and with 3 face-to-face work sessions in compulsory class time.

- Milestone 1: Selection and Exploration of a dataset, Proposal of Experiments and Preliminary Results.  A report is handed in and a 3-minute presentation is made.

- Milestone 2 : Final Report and 15 minutes Presentation.

The report is incremental and is presented in a web page format (HTML).

You have a 1 week late payment period with 1 point deductions per day.

### Notes

- There are: Project Note (NP), Laboratory Note (NL) and Mini-controls Note (NC).

- The project grade is divided into a milestone 1 grade (H1) and a milestone 2 grade (H3). Each milestone also includes a co-assessment mark. If the co-evaluation mark is higher than 4, then it is worth 20% of the milestone mark. Otherwise (less than 4), the mark for the entire milestone will be equal to the co-assessment mark, after discussion of the teaching staff with the group.

- Laboratory mark = Average (BEST7(L1,L2,L3,L4,...,LR)).

- Grade Mini Controls = Average (BEST7(C1,C2,C3,C4,...,CR)).

- Project grade = 0.4 \* H1 + 0.6 \* H2 

- Final Grade = NP \* 0.4 + NL \* 0.45 + NC \* 0.15

#### Passing Requirements (ALL OF THEM must be reached)

1. NP >= 4.0 and NL >= 4.0 and NCL >= 4.0

2. Labs may be in pairs, no copying between sections or between groups (reason for final grade assignments = 1.0).

### Details on the Mini-Control grade replacement mechanism with the Remedial

The mini-control automatically replaces the worst mini-control grade (including an unexcused absence) without the need for justification.

If a mini-control is missed and a formal justification is provided, the make-up mini-control replaces that absence, but does not replace the worst grade of the attended mini-controls or any unexcused absences.

If there are two or more formally excused absences, the make-up mini-check replaces all of them, but does not replace the worst mark for the mini-checks attended or for any unexcused absences.

In short, think carefully before missing a mini-control, because if you miss another one, even if it is justified, you will not be able to replace both absences with the make-up mini-control.

The mechanisms of justification are those established by the school.
